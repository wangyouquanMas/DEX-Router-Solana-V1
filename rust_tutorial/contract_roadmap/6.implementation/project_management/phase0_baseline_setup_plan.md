# Phase 0 Baseline Setup Execution Plan

**Objective**: Verify that the Anchor project scaffold compiles and runs so the development environment is reliable for subsequent contract work.

**Action Steps**
- Step 1: In the project root, run `anchor --version` and `solana --version`, confirm the toolchain versions meet expectations, and record them.
- Step 2: Run `anchor build`, review the output, and if compilation fails, capture the error details and create an entry in the `error_logs` directory.
- Step 3: Run `anchor test` to confirm the integration-test scaffold passes; if not, pinpoint the failing test and fix it.
- Step 4: Summarize the commands and their results in `contract_roadmap/6.implementation/1.anchor_tutorial/readme.md` for future reference.

**Completion Criteria**: Both `anchor build` and `anchor test` succeed without unresolved errors, and the log documentation is updated.

---

**Objective**: Establish a modular skeleton for the contract project by defining the `state`, `instructions`, `errors`, `events`, and `utils` directories, creating a solid structure for phased development.

**Action Steps**
- Step 1: Under `programs/fun-uniswap-v3/src`, create the `state`, `instructions`, `errors`, `events`, and `utils` submodule files (e.g., `mod.rs` plus specific implementation files).
- Step 2: Import the new modules in `lib.rs`, keeping the entry file well organized, and add the necessary `pub use` exports.
- Step 3: Add placeholder comments or basic structs/enums in each module so future work has a clear starting point.
- Step 4: Update `1.anchor_tutorial/readme.md` with the module plan and a description of each module’s purpose.

**Completion Criteria**: `lib.rs` references all modules successfully and `anchor build` passes; the directory structure is clear and the documentation explains each module’s responsibility.

---

**Objective**: Define Phase 0 documentation and version-control practices to keep later changes traceable and reusable.

**Action Steps**
- Step 1: Add a Phase 0 section to `contract_roadmap/6.implementation/1.anchor_tutorial/readme.md` covering goals, key commands, and common issues.
- Step 2: Whenever issues arise, append entries to `error_logs/Anchor测试环境问题排查.md` with the symptoms, root cause, and solution.
- Step 3: After completing all tasks, run `git status` to review changes, split commits as needed, and follow the `git add`, `git commit -m "Error summary"`, `git push` workflow.

**Completion Criteria**: Documentation now includes Phase 0 guidance with operating instructions; the error log is up to date; the repository changes are pushed to remote.
