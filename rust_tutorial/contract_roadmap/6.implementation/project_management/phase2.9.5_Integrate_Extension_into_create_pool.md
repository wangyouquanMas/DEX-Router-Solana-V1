Great! With the bitmap extension code in place, the next step is to wire it into the pool creation flow so pools actually allocate and reference that extension.

### Next Step: Integrate Extension into `create_pool`

- **Allocate** a `TickArrayBitmapExtensionAccount` PDA alongside the existing bitmap during `create_pool`.
- **Store** its address in `PoolState` (we already added the field).
- **Emit** the extension PDA in `PoolCreatedEvent`.
- **Use** the extension when validating or flipping bits on tick arrays later (e.g., hand it through remaining accounts for instructions that need it).

Once that’s done, we can move on to tightening validations (open-time checks, mint allowlists) and eventually add tests. Let me know when you’re ready to execute this integration or if you’d like a rough code outline first.

We’ve now integrated the tick-array bitmap extension into `create_pool`:

- Allocates the extension PDA alongside the base bitmap.
- Stores both addresses in `PoolState`.
- Emits them via `PoolCreatedEvent`.
- Initializes the extension account during pool creation.

```1:208:programs/fun-uniswap-v3/src/instructions/create_pool.rs
#[account(
    init,
    payer = payer,
    space = TickArrayBitmapExtensionAccount::space(),
    seeds = tick_array_bitmap_extension_seeds(&pool_state.key()),
    bump,
)]
pub tick_array_bitmap_extension: Account<'info, TickArrayBitmapExtensionAccount>,
…
accounts.tick_array_bitmap.initialize(pool_state.key());
accounts
    .tick_array_bitmap_extension
    .initialize(pool_state.key());

emit!(PoolCreatedEvent {
    …
    observation: accounts.observation_state.key(),
    tick_array_bitmap: accounts.tick_array_bitmap.key(),
    tick_array_bitmap_extension: accounts.tick_array_bitmap_extension.key(),
    …
});
```

### What’s still open
The Rust tests (Step 9) haven’t been written yet. They’ll require a `solana_program_test` harness to cover the scenarios you outlined (success, duplicate init, mint order mismatch, authority mismatch). When you’re ready, I can draft that harness next.
