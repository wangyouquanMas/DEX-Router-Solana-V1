- Refactored `initialize_amm_config` internals into reusable `initialize_config_account` and `validate_fee_inputs` helpers so logic is testable in isolation.
- Added three `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests right in `initialize_amm_config.rs`:
  - happy path populates PDA with bumps/authority/fees,
  - rejects trade fee above `MAX_TRADE_FEE_RATE`,
  - rejects combined fees above `FEE_RATE_DENOMINATOR`.
- Wired the instruction through `lib.rs` so the top-level program exposes `initialize_amm_config`.

Run `cargo test` inside `programs/fun-uniswap-v3/` (or `anchor test`) to verify everything passes after the refactor.
