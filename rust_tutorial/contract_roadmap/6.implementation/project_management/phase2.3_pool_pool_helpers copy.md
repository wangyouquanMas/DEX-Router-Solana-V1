- Added `PoolState` definition in `state/pool_state.rs` with seeds, layout constants, and signer helpers; used in future pool instructions.

Next steps: review derived constants vs. future instruction needs; expand fields later if you need rewards or tick-bitmaps stored inline. Consider running your tests after adding handlers.
