Great plan. Here’s a structured list of the key gaps we still need to close, broken down so we can tackle them one by one:

1. Observation/Tick State  
   - Port the real `ObservationState` and `TickArrayBitmapExtension` logic (tick math, TWAP updates, bitmap flips, etc.).

2. Token Vault Utilities  
   - Implement the full `create_token_vault_account` flow: PDA allocation, immutable-owner handling, whitelist/supported mint checks, Token-2022 compatibility.

3. `create_pool` Handler  
   - Integrate vault creation, observation init, tick array bitmap init, open-time constraint, tick derivation (`tick_math`), and support remaining error cases.

4. Math & Validation Support  
   - Bring over the math libraries (`tick_math`, fixed-point utilities, etc.) and any validation helpers referenced by pool logic.

5. Error & Event Usage  
   - Ensure newly added error codes are actually triggered and events capture all Raydium fields.

6. Testing  
   - Add Rust unit/integration tests with `solana_program_test` for the create-pool happy path and failure cases (duplicate init, mint mismatch, authority mismatch).  
   - Update/extend TypeScript tests for the new instruction.

Once we agree on this list (and possibly refine it further), we can pick the first task—say, observation/tick state—and start porting it together. Let me know which item you’d like to focus on first.
