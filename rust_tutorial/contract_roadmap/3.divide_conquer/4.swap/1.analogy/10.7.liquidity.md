1. 含义

1.1 池子的流动性


1.2 tick的流动性

不同tick范围对应的流动性不同。 比如rangeA[tick_lower_a, tick_upper_b] 它们表示一个范围，这个范围内的流动性体现在tick_lower_a,tick_upper_b的 liquidity_net 和liquidity_gross字段中。 

For small enough swaps, that do not move the price past a tick, the contracts act like an x*y = k pool. 
Each tick tracks delatL, the total amount of liquidity that should be kicked in or out when the tick is crossed. 
liquidityGross. This value ensures that even if net liquidity at a tick is 0, we can still know if a tick is referenced by at least one underlying position or not, which tells us whether to update the tick bitmap


Pools track L , which is the total liquidity provided by all price ranges that include the current price. 
It's expected that, during big price moves, the current price moves outside of price ranges.
When this happens, such price ranges become inactive and their liquidity get subtracted from L. 
On the other hand, when the current enters a price range, L is increased and the price range gets activated.





问题：
如果ticks 交叉，下面值会发生什么变化？

1). liquidity_net 

2). liquidity_gross

问题：
1. 真正去理解liquidity的变化情况及原因，还是要结合fee收益和流动性份额一起来分析。
