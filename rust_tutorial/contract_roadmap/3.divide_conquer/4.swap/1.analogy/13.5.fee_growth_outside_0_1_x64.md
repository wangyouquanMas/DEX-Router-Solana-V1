1. 作用

public struct TickState{
   /// Fee growth per unit of liquidity on the _other_ side of this tick (relative to the current tick)
    /// only has relative meaning, not absolute — the value depends on when the tick is initialized
    pub fee_growth_outside_0_x64: u128,
    pub fee_growth_outside_1_x64: u128,
}
The contract needs to store information about each tick in order to
track the amount of net liquidity that should be added or removed
when the tick is crossed, as well as to track the fees earned above
and below that tick.


feeGrowthOutside{0,1} are used to track how many fees were accumulated within a given range. Since the formulas are the same for the fees collected in token0 and token1

You can compute the fees earned per unit of liquidity in token 0 above (𝑓𝑎) and below (𝑓𝑏) a tick 𝑖 with a formula that depends on whether the price is currently within or outside that range—that is,
whether the current tick index 𝑖𝑐 is greater than or equal to i.

outside是在LP提供的position的tick边界之外的费用，发生在cross tick时
