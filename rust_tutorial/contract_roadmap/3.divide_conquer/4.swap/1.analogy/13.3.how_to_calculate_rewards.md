1. 原理
1）Fee Growth Delta: The system calculates the difference between current fee growth and the last recorded fee growth:
   let fee_growth_delta = current_fee_growth - fee_growth_inside_0_last_x64;

2）Reward Calculation: Your share of fees is proportional to your liquidity:
   let amount_owed_delta = (fee_growth_delta * your_liquidity) / 2^64;
   
3）Total Rewards: The token_fees_owed_0 and token_fees_owed_1 fields accumulate these calculated fees over time.


1.1 举例
If you have 1000 liquidity units in a pool with 10000 total liquidity, you own 10% of the position and will earn 10% of all trading fees generated within your tick range.


1.2 代码理解
The update_rewards method in the code shows exactly how this calculation is performed for both trading fees and additional reward tokens.
